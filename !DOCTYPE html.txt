        <h2>Housing Market News & Interest Rates</h2>
        <p>Lower mortgage rates are being observed today, which could be a positive sign for the housing market in 2025. However, high home prices and limited inventory continue to be challenges.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>30-year fixed-rate:</b> 6.65% (-0.09% from last week)</li>
            <li><b>15-year fixed-rate:</b> 5.88% (-0.10% from last week)</li>
            <li><b>30-year fixed-rate jumbo:</b> 6.71% (-0.04% from last week)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lingering inflation and concerns about global trade continue to influence rate fluctuations. Most experts anticipate the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to remain between 6.5% and 7% for the remainder of the year.</p>

        <h2>Mortgage Calculator - $380,000 80/20 Loan</h2>
        <p>For an $380,000 home with an 80/20 loan, this means a loan amount of $304,000 (80% of $380,000) and a down payment of $76,000 (20% of $380,000).</p>
        <p>Assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at the current average of 6.65%:</p>
        <div class="mortgage-calculator">
            <p><b>Loan Amount:</b> $304,000</p>
            <p><b>Interest Rate:</b> 6.65% per year (0.0665 / 12 = 0.00554167 per month)</p>
            <p><b>Loan Term:</b> 30 years (30 * 12 = 360 months)</p>
            <p>The monthly payment (principal and interest only) can be calculated using the formula: M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1 ]</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>M = Monthly Payment</li>
                <li>P = Principal Loan Amount ($304,000)</li>
                <li>i = Monthly Interest Rate (0.00554167)</li>
                <li>n = Total Number of Payments (360)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>M = 304000 * [ 0.00554167(1 + 0.00554167)^360 ] / [ (1 + 0.00554167)^360 – 1 ]</p>
            <p>M ≈ <b>$1960.87</b> (This payment does not include property taxes or homeowner's insurance.)</p>
